# Reponsibilities of a Tech Lead

## "Kümmerer" Mentality
- Sorry the german wird explains it best (sich kümmern = take care about sth.)
- It's someone who takes care about evertyhing, not only Software Development.
- Tech Lead takes care about overall-architecture, frontend-design, backends, UX, Client needs, Mood etc.

## When Not to code
- Recall YAGNI
- Less code is better

## How to build a feature?
- discussing & understanding requirements
- ask the 5 Whys to really understand the customers need - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys
- Very often the customer requests a specific feature instead of describing a problem. Dig for the root cause of the feature!
- Using the 5-Whys could reveal the root cause! In my personal experience, 3-Whys are often enough.
