# Survival Guide for Software Engineers

## Train coding problems and use platforms like „Hackerrank“, „Project Euler“, "Leetcode"

## Know concepts of Object-Oriented / Functional programming
There are always pros and cons for both. Learn them and how to apply them. Don't be a "Functional programmer" or "Object-Oriented programmer".
Be a smart programmer ;-)...no reason to be dogmatic!

## Have code examples on github


## Participate open-source projects on github

## Take online courses, go to conferences and do onside trainings
* A very incomplete list of good conferences to check out (alongside their topic): GOTO; (General), Strange Loop (General), PyCon (Python), CPPCon (C++), DEF CON (Security), Fluent (Web dev), JAX (JavaCon) ...
* MOOCs: https://www.coursera.org/ , https://www.educative.io/ ...

## Learn one new programming language per year
Not in detail, but learn the main concepts, benefits and drawbacks of a language.

## Try cutting edge technologies for your projects
Even in the context of client environment, you should try to use new technologies. You can always use a hybrid approach were you can switch between "old" and "new" technology.

## Know When to Use Libraries

* Open source, so you can verify the quality of code yourself and potentially fix bugs that are critical to your application.
* Licensed under a permissive license such as MIT and BSD, so your company doesn’t run into any issues by using it. Be careful with GPL, lest you open source your entire code base by accident.
* Mature, i.e. it has been out for some time and has a rich set of features.
* Maintained, with new releases coming out often. Used by other companies or projects, which acts as a stamp of approval and ensures it has industry support for continued maintenance.
  
## Debugging and Reading Code
* You’ll need a lot more than debugging using print statements. All widely-used languages and tech stacks have a variety of powerful tools. Learn to use them as they’ll make debugging a breeze and save you countless hours.
* Understand the code base. Most tech stacks have some sort of code graph generation tools that will help you understand the structure of the code base. Enterprise IDEs generally have that functionality built in. You can also explore the code using tools such as ReSharper, grep or Sourcegraph.
* Understand the product. You’ll be surprised how many developers don’t know how the software is supposed to work before they try to “fix” it. Just read the documentation. 

## Learn Test-Driven-Development
It will significantly improve your code! Also it makes fun to have always direct feedback that your code works or not.
